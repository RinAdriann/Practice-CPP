# C++ Practice and Class Work

Hey there, as the name suggests this repo is a place for me to keep all the stuff that I did during my 1st semester in Gajah Mada University. 
Looking back at it reminds me of how much I learned just from trying things and how grateful I am for my lecturers that taught me in ways that I can not express in just words.

Enjoy looking around.
